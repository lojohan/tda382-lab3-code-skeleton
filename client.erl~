%% inititial_state/2 and handle/2 are used togetger with the genserver module,
%% explained in the lecture about Generic server.

initial_state(Nick, GUIName) ->

%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

%% handle/2 handles each kind of request from GUI

%% All requests are processed by handle/2 receiving the request data (and the
%% current state), performing the needed actions, and returning a tuple
%% {reply, Reply, NewState}, where Reply is the reply to be sent to the
%% requesting process and NewState is the new state of the client.
